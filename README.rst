automatepracticeprojects
========================

Example implementations of the practice projects in `Automate the Boring Stuff with Python`_.

I totally got these from my `python-tutorials`_ repo (yay MIT License?), but they are easier to find and review here.

Bonus content includes Google style docstrings (such wow), main functions (so standard), a requirements.txt file (so
helpful), and test files (**not** punny at all).

.. Note::Chapter 18 has two missing projects: *Instant Messenger Bot* and *Game-Playing Bot Tutorial*.

    For *Instant Messenger Bot*, I want to use Empathy on Ubuntu because it is the default IMing program. The only
    protocol I'm willing to make test accounts for is ICQ (because who uses ICQ?), but ICQ now requires a valid phone
    number for registration. That's as far as my eagerness wanted to go. I'll probably have to cave and use Pidgin or
    IRC or something.

    After the IM Bot fiasco, I ran out of steam for *Game-Playing Bot Tutorial*. I'll revisit these two in the future.
